# Hazorfim Store - E-commerce Project  

This repository contains the initial stages of development for the **Hazorfim Store**, an e-commerce platform built with **React** on the front end and **Node.js** with **Express** on the back end.  

## Main Function Points  

- **E-commerce Platform**: The project aims to create a fully functional online store for Hazorfim, enabling product browsing, order management, and customer interaction.  
- **Client-Side (React)**: The front-end of the project is built using **React**, providing a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience for a smooth and fast user interface.  
- **Server-Side (Node.js & Express)**: The back-end is powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, offering a RESTful API to handle requests, such as product management, user authentication, and order processing.  
- **Early Development Stage**: The repository is currently in its initial stages, with only a few commits and basic file structure in place. Further development is planned to implement full functionality and features.  

## Technology Stack  

- **React**: JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.  
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.  
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to handle API requests and server-side logic.  
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling for the user interface, providing the layout and design of the platform.
